# AdaptFL: Federated Learning Architecture for Privacy and Data Diversity

## Overview

**AdaptFL** is a proposed federated learning framework designed to address the challenges of data heterogeneity and privacy in distributed systems. This project aims to create an adaptable architecture that securely aggregates and learns from diverse data sources without compromising user privacy.

## Project Status

This project is currently in the planning and architecture phase. The conceptual design, architecture, and overall project plan have been outlined, and the implementation phase will follow. The repository will be updated as the development progresses.

## Features

The planned features for AdaptFL include:

- **Privacy-Preserving Training**: Implementation of differential privacy and secure aggregation to protect user data.
- **Handling Data Heterogeneity**: Support for multiple data types (e.g., images, sensor data, time-series) within a single federated learning model.
- **Scalable Federated Learning**: Design of a federated learning system that can scale across distributed networks.

## Architecture

The architecture for AdaptFL consists of:

```python
1. **Local Multi-Input Models**: Each device will have a local model that processes diverse data types.
2. **Differential Privacy Mechanisms**: Techniques to ensure that individual data points cannot be reconstructed from the aggregated data.
3. **Global Model Aggregation**: A centralized system that averages the weights from local models without accessing raw data.
4. **Model Distribution**: The global model is distributed back to the devices for improved performance and accuracy.
```

## Contributing
Since the project is in its early stages, contributions are welcome in the form of design discussions, architecture suggestions, and future implementation plans. *Please open an issue or start a discussion if you have ideas to share.*
